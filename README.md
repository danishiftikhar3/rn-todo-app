Hi
To run this app, download the whole app and then unzip it. 
run the command npm i 
if you are on the macos, you need to start android or ios emulator. 
once you do, just run commad react-native run-android 
OR
react-native run-ios 

ABOUT THE APP.
This app first allows you to create a list 
and then on that list you can add multiple tasks. 
you can add multiple lists also.
The app data is saved using async function. 
The state manegment is donw using redux. 
I've added the innvoationSprint logo as the app icon for both ios and iphone. 
added an loading screen.
